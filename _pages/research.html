    <h2>The Border</h2>
    <p>
I'm interested in dialect contact between Canadian and American English and the effect of the border.
  I've been looking at Canadians and Americans who live near the border in Niagara, ON and Niagara, NY.
  Here is a painting I did of the Horseshoe Falls from the Canadian side in Niagara Falls, ON.
