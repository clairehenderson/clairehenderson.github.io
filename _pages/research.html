    <h2>The Border</h2>
    <p>
My main research is about dialect contact between Canadian and American English and the effect of the border on diffusion.
  I've been looking at Canadians and Americans who live near the border in Niagara, ON and Niagara, NY.
       I'm interested in how place identity and its connection with place-linked features like Canadian Raising and the Northern Cities Shift might affect which features are adopted/maintained.

  Here's a painting I did of the Horseshoe Falls (from the Canadian side)!

    <h2>The New Survey of Canadian English</h2>
    <p>
I'm also interested in Canadian English more broadly and our unique vocabulary, spelling, and pronunciations.
       In 2022-2023, I conducted a Canada-wide survey of Canadian English with Charles Boberg at McGill University.
       We've looked at real time change in comparison to Scargill & Warkentyne's (1972) Survey of Canadian English, apparent time change in the new data, and regional variation across Canada.
