I'm a PhD student in the Linguistics Department at Georgetown University. My research looks at dialect contact and change in Canadian and American English. I'm especially interested in phonetic variation and the spread of features like Canadian Raising, the low back merger, and the Low-Back-Merger Shift.

I previously completed my MA at McGill University, where I looked at language variation and diffusion in Canadian and American English along the Niagara border between Ontario and New York State.
