I'm a PhD student in the Linguistics Department at Georgetown University. My research looks at dialect contact and change in Canadian and American English. I'm especially interested in phonetic variation and the spread of features like Canadian Raising, the Low-Back-Merger Shift, and the Northern Cities Shift.

I previously completed my MA at McGill University, where I looked at dialect diffusion between Canadian and American English along the Niagara border between Ontario and New York State.
